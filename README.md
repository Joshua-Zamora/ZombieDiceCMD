Virtual video game for the dice game, Zombie Dice

-	A group of 4 other students and I developed a dice game virtually. 
We accomplished this task in stages by first creating a simpler version of the game playable from the command console. 
Then I extended it onto an application using Java, HTML, JavaFX and CSS. 
Finally, we are currently working on developing it with the game engine Unity using JavaScript. 
Each iteration of the game has had a fully functional UI system that 
consisted of a menu, account creation, settings, options, and storage for user stats.
