							   On your turn you roll only 3 die.
					    The Green dice are the easiest. Yellow are medium. Red are the hardest.
							     The dice have three symbols:

		Brain: Each brain is 1 point towards your overall score

		Footprints: If you choose to roll again, you will re-roll these dice. 
			    Along with enough new ones to bring the total to three.

		Shotgun: If you roll three shotguns, your turn is over. 
			 Otherwise, you can choose to stop and score, or continue.

		Green dice contain: 3 BRAINS, 2 FEET, 1 SHOTGUN
		Yellow dice contain: 2 BRAINS, 2 FEET, 2 SHOTGUNS
		Red dice contain: 1 BRAIN, 2 FEET, 3 SHOTGUNS

			   If you decide to stop on your turn, each brain scores you 1 point. It's now the next player's turn.
			      Keep repeating until someone reaches 13 Brains. Once 13 brains are scored, finish the round. 

					Whoever has the most Brains at the end of that round is the winner. 
					     If there is a tie, only the leaders play a tiebreaker round.
