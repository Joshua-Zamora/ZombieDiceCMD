					You will always start your turn by rolling 3 regular dice. 
			After that, any time you draw dice, you may take the School Bus instead of drawing one regular die. 
					    The School bus has 12 faces containing the following:

	    Brain: The Brain has its normal meaning.

	    Shotgun: The Shotgun has its normal meaning.

	    Brain/Shotgun: Sometimes you'll get both Brains and Shotguns.

	    Stop: Your turn is over. If you're up to three Shotguns, you score nothing. 
		  Otherwise, score the Brains you have.

	    Yield: All Shotguns on this roll become Feet.

	    Dead End: All Feet on this roll become Brains.

	    Run Over: Lose one rolled Brain. You can't roll the School Bus die any more on this turn.

			   While you are on the school bus you have two choices:
						
		     (1) Get off. Reroll Feet if you have any, plus enough new dice to total three but you can't roll the bus any more this turn. 
		     (2) Or stay on the bus. The Feet are discarded. Draw two new dice to go with the School Bus die, and roll again.
